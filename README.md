# Project-Supervised-Regression-models

## Introduction

Supervised regression is a powerful machine learning technique used to predict continuous target variables based on a set of input features. In this project, we will explore several regression algorithms, including linear regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), gradient boosting, random forest, decision tree, and AdaBoost. We will also utilize one-hot encoding and column transformation techniques to preprocess the data effectively. Our dataset contains various features related to cars, such as car ID, symboling, car name, fuel type, aspiration, door number, car body type, drivewheel type, engine location, wheelbase, and many more.
## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to build regression models that can predict the price of a car based on a set of input features.

## Model Building:

Create multiple regression models, including:
Linear Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting
Random Forest
Decision Tree
AdaBoost
## Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Compare the models and identify the one that performs best on the test data.

## Conclusion:

Summarize the results and findings from the models.
Provide insights into which features are most important in predicting car prices.
Discuss any limitations of the models and potential areas for improvement.

This supervised regression project aims to provide valuable insights into predicting car prices based on various features and comparing the performance of different regression models. It also showcases the importance of data preprocessing and model selection in achieving accurate predictions.
